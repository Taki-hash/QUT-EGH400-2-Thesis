# Buck Converter THD Analysis for EIS Applications

This repository supports the thesis titled **"Linearity and General Analysis of Sinusoidal Injection Locations in Buck Converters for Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy"**, completed as part of EGH400-2 at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) located in Brisbane, QLD.

## ðŸ§ª Project Summary

This project analyzes how sinusoidal signal injections at different nodes in a buck converter affect Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and frequency response characteristics. The goal is to determine the most suitable injection location for EIS measurements on DC-DC coupled PEM electrolysis systems.

Key contributions:
- Implementation of a nonlinear buck converter model.
- THD calculation and summation across injection signal with respect to two relevant fundemental frequencies.
- Comparison of input, output, and PWM injection locations.
- Analysis of the trade-off between bandwidth and distortion.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Used MATLAB Version R2024b
- Control System Toolbox (for Bode analysis)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for FFT)

## ðŸ“ˆ How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the desired analysis script (`NonlinearAnalysis_IN.m`, etc.).
3. Use the plots and THD results to compare injection points.
4. All scripts are commented and modular for modification or integration.
